# HackGrader

Hackathon scraper and code grader

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

The project spins up and hosts a model locally for the analysis phase. Ensure that you have [ollama](https://ollama.com/) installed as well as the [qwen2.5-coder](https://ollama.com/library/qwen2.5-coder) model pulled. Additionally, you will need either [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) or pip to install packages for the scraper. The code is built around [python](https://www.python.org/) versions ```>=3.14```.

### Installation

Pull the code locally

```bash
# clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/Google-Developers-Student-Club-LSU/HackGrader.git

# cd into the project
cd hackGrader
```

Install the qwen2.5-coder model

```bash
ollama pull qwen2.5-coder:7b
```

#### Standard

Create your virtual environment

```bash
# Windows 10/11
python -m venv .venv

# Linux/MacOS 
python3 -m venv .venv
```

Source into your virtual environment

```bash
# Windows 10/11
. .venv/bin/activate.ps1

# Linux/MacOS 
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Install the packages

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### UV

Create the virtual environment

```bash
uv init
```

install the packages

```bash
uv sync
```

### Running

Run the pipeline with the devpost url

```bash
# standard run
python src/hackGrader/__init__.py https://example.devpost.com

# uv run
uv run https://example.devpost.com
```

### Testing

Testing the crawling, scoring, or entire pipeline can be done entirely through the test scripts - run_test.ps1 or run_test.sh

flags:

- c : crawling
- s : scoring

if no flags are provided, then the entire pipeline will be tested.

```bash
# example script execution
./run_test -c
```
